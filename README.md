# Excel-Interactive-Dashboard-Kids-Screen-Time

## 🎯 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze **average screen time among kids under 18 years** and study its **impact on health, lifestyle, and education balance**.  
An interactive Excel dashboard highlights age-wise, gender-wise, and urban–rural patterns to understand how screen exposure relates to health risks.


## ❓ Key Questions
- What is the **average screen time** across different age groups and genders?  
- Which **devices (Smartphone, Laptop, Tablet, TV)** are most associated with screen exposure?  
- How does **urban vs rural location** influence screen time exceedance?  
- What are the most common **health impacts** (eye strain, anxiety, obesity risk) of excessive screen time?  
- How much of screen time is spent on **education vs recreation**?

## 🔄 Process
1. **Data Preparation** – Cleaned and organized data with age groups, gender, device, rural/urban, and health impacts.  
2. **Pivot Analysis** – Built Pivot Tables to calculate averages and ratios.  
3. **Visualization** – Created charts for cross-analysis:  
   - Bar chart (Average screen time by gender & device)  
   - Stacked bar chart (Age groups with health impacts)  
   - Pie chart (Health impacts by device)  
   - Radar chart (Edu-to-recreational ratio)  
   - Column chart (Urban vs Rural exceeded limits)  
4. **Dashboard** – Combined visuals into an interactive Excel dashboard.  

## 🔍 Project Insights
- **Average screen time is 4–5 hours/day**, which exceeds the healthy benchmark.  
- **Smartphones** are the leading contributor to screen exposure, followed by laptops.  
- **Urban kids** show significantly higher screen time exceedance than rural kids.  
- **Health impacts**: Eye strain and anxiety are the most reported issues, with obesity risk increasing in higher age groups.  
- **Educational vs Recreational ratio** is skewed towards recreation, showing less academic use.
