# Excel-Interactive-Dashboard-Kids-Screen-Time

## 🎯 Project Objective
The aim of this project is to analyze **screen time behavior among kids under 18 years** and assess its **impact on health, lifestyle, and education balance**.  
An interactive Excel dashboard was built to uncover device usage patterns, urban–rural differences, and the relationship between screen exposure and health risks.

## ❓ Key Questions
- What is the **average daily screen time** across different age groups?  
- Which **devices (Smartphone, Laptop, Tablet, TV)** are most frequently used?  
- Are there differences in **screen usage between boys and girls**?  
- How does **urban vs rural location** impact screen time and limit exceedance?  
- What are the common **health issues** caused by excessive screen time?  
- How much of screen time is spent on **education vs recreation**?

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Average Screen Time (hrs/day) by **device, age group, gender**  
- % of Kids **Exceeding Recommended Screen Limit** (2 hrs/day benchmark)  
- Frequency of **Health Impacts** (Eye strain, Anxiety, Obesity Risk, etc.)  
- **Edu-to-Recreational Ratio** of screen usage  
- Urban vs Rural **Exceedance Comparison**  
- Device-specific **Impact Contribution**

## 🔄 Process
1. **Data Collection** – Gathered data on age, gender, screen time, device used, urban/rural, health impact, and usage type.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Standardized formats, grouped ages, categorized health impacts.  
3. **Data Analysis** – Built **Pivot Tables, Slicers, Charts** for cross-analysis.  
4. **Dashboard Creation** – Developed interactive visuals:  
   - Bar charts (Cross analysis by gender & device)  
   - Stacked bar chart (Age groups with health impacts)  
   - Pie chart (Health impact by device)  
   - Radar chart (Edu-to-recreational ratio)  
   - Column chart (Urban vs Rural exceeded limits)  
5. **Insights & Reporting** – Highlighted key findings and risks.

## 🔍 Project Insights
- **Smartphones** contribute the most to screen time, followed by laptops.  
- **Average screen time is 4–5 hours/day**, exceeding the healthy limit.  
- **Health issues**: Eye strain and anxiety are the most common impacts.  
- **Urban kids** exceed screen limits more than rural kids (5851 vs 2441 cases).  
- **Teenagers (14–18 years)** are most at risk of multiple health problems.  
- **Educational vs Recreational use ratio** is skewed, with more time spent on entertainment.
